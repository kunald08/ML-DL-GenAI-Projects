# Titanic — Short EDA

What this is
- Simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.
- No model training — just data exploration, visualizations, and a profiling report to help you understand the dataset.

Files included
- `TitanicEDA.ipynb` — the Jupyter notebook with the EDA, plots and notes.
- `soitsmenia_Titanic_yprofiling.html` — an HTML profiling report generated from the notebook (open in a browser).

Quick start
1. Open the notebook: launch Jupyter or open `TitanicEDA.ipynb` in VS Code / Jupyter Lab and run the cells.
2. View the report: open `soitsmenia_Titanic_yprofiling.html` in any web browser.

Requirements (typical)
- Python 3.8+ (or your environment of choice)
- Common libraries used in EDA: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- If the profiling report was produced using ydata-profiling (or pandas-profiling): `ydata-profiling` (or `pandas-profiling`).
